So, I have this website, it's getting too hard to maintain. I want to create a project with React + Vite + Tailwind + ShadCN

```
Project Setup Prompt: React + Vite + Tailwind + ShadCN

Set up a modern React project using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI components.

Use TypeScript

Use Vite as the build tool

Use Tailwind CSS for styling

Add ShadCN UI for components (https://ui.shadcn.com
)

Structure components cleanly (e.g., /components, /pages)

Ensure it's SEO-friendly:

Add meta tags (via react-helmet-async or similar)

Include basic <title> and <meta name="description"> for each page

Setup routing with React Router

Deliver a clean, scalable codebase
```

the pages that i need are

- ./contact.html
- ./policies.html
- ./products.html
- ./services.html

They are in the project, you can use them and copy a lot of the content and the structure too if you want, but don't have to do the exact thing.
