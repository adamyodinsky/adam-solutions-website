## Suggested Website Requirements for Lemon Squeezy Activation

Here’s a refined specification you can pass to your web manager:

---

### 1. Home / Landing Page

- **Business name** prominently displayed: “Adam DevOps Solutions Ltd (Adam Solutions)”
- Short tagline: e.g., “Digital products & DevOps consulting”
- Brief overview of offerings: _Circle app_, _ChatGPT-Kit_, **DevOps & freelance software engineering services**.

### 2. Products Page (or Section)

- List both products:

  - **Circle** — brief description of what it does, platform (mobile), and value proposition.
  - **Chatchapiti Kit** — Chrome extension, key features, what it solves.

- Clearly state: these are **digital products**; no physical fulfillment.

### 3. Services / Consulting Page

- List freelancing/consulting offerings — DevOps, app development, custom projects.
- Clarify these are **services**, not physical goods.

### 4. Contact / Support

- A visible **contact email** (e.g., [info@adamsolutions.com](mailto:info@adamsolutions.com)) or a working contact form.
- Optional: social media links or messaging support if preferred.

### 5. Policies

Create a single **Policies** page (or multiple linked subpages) incorporating:

#### a) **Refund & Dispute Policy**

- Example wording:

  > “All sales are final for digital products. If you experience technical issues, contact us within 14 days for support and potential exceptions.”

#### b) **Cancellation Policy**

- Especially relevant for _ChatGPT-Kit_ subscription:

  > “Subscriptions can be canceled at any time via the customer portal provided by Lemon Squeezy; access continues until the billing period ends.”

#### c) **Terms & Conditions**

- Brief but clear:

  - Use of software/products is governed by these terms.
  - License usage, prohibited behaviors, no resale, etc.
  - Liability disclaimers.

#### d) **Legal / Export Restrictions**

- Example:

  > “Products are delivered digitally globally. We comply with export regulations; if you experience purchase issues due to regional restrictions, contact us.”

### 6. Public Accessibility & Domain

- Ensure all critical pages (home, products, contact, policy) are publicly accessible and don’t require login.
- Use a proper **custom domain** (e.g., `adamsolutions.com`), not just a placeholder or internal ref.
- Be prepared to verify domain ownership if requested during Lemon Squeezy review.
